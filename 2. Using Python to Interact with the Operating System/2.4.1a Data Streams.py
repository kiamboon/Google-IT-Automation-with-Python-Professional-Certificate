"""Standard Streams"""
# STDIN - the standard input stream which is a channel between a program and a source of input
# STDOUT - the standard output stream which is a pathway between a program and a target of output
# SDTERR - the standard error stream which displays output like standard out, but is used specifically as a channel to show error messages and diagnostics from the program

data = input("This comes from STDIN: ")
print("We are writing it to STDOUT: " + data)
# print("We are generating an error to STDERR: " + data + 1)


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"""Environment Variables"""
# os module provides environ dictionary
import os

# environ variables allows us to access environment variables
# .get() function specifies a default value when the key that we're looking for isn't in the dictionary
print("HOME: " + os.environ.get("HOME", ""))
print("SHELL: " + os.environ.get("SHELL", ""))

# export FRUIT=Pineapple  # we define the variable by just setting a value using the equal sign and leaving no spaces in between
print("FRUIT: " + os.environ.get("FRUIT", ""))


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"""Command-Line Arguments and Exit Status"""
import sys
print(sys.argv)

import os

# Receives a file name as a command line argument
# filename = sys.argv[0]

# Checks whether the file name exist or not
# When the file doesn't exist, it creates it by writing a line to it
# if not os.path.exists(filename):
#      with open(filename, "w") as f:
#          f.write("New file created\n")
# When the file exist, our script print an error message and exits with an exit value of one
# else:
#     print("Error, the file {} already exists!".format(filename))
#     sys.exit(1)
