'''
Imagine one of your IT coworkers just retired and left a folder of scripts for you to use. One of the scripts, called emails.py, matches users to an email address and lets us easily look them up! For the most part, the script works great â€” you enter in an employee's name and their email is printed to the screen. But, for some employees, the output doesn't look quite right. Your job is to add a test to reproduce the bug, make the necessary corrections, and verify that all the tests pass to make sure the script works! 

- Write a simple test to check for basic functionality
- Write a test to check for edge cases
- Correct code with a try/except statement
